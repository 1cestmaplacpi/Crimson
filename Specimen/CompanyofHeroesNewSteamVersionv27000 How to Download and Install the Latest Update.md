## How to master the infantry combat in Company of Heroes
 
Infantry units are the backbone of any army in Company of Heroes. They can capture and hold strategic points, engage enemy infantry and vehicles, and support your armor and artillery. However, infantry combat is not as simple as sending your squads to the front line and hoping for the best. You need to use cover, flanking, suppression, upgrades and abilities to gain an edge over your opponent. Here are some tips to help you improve your infantry skills:

- Use cover whenever possible. Cover reduces the damage and suppression your infantry receive from enemy fire. There are three types of cover: green (heavy), yellow (light) and red (negative). Green cover provides the most protection, while red cover makes your infantry more vulnerable. You can see the type of cover by hovering your mouse over the terrain or by pressing the spacebar.
- Flank enemy units that are in cover or suppressed. Flanking means attacking from the side or rear of an enemy unit, where they have less or no cover and can't fire back effectively. Flanking can also break suppression, which is a state where your infantry can't move or fire due to heavy enemy fire. You can use fast units like jeeps, bikes or assault infantry to flank enemy positions.
- Suppress enemy infantry with machine guns, mortars or abilities. Suppression is a powerful tool to pin down enemy infantry and prevent them from advancing or retreating. Machine guns can suppress infantry in a wide arc in front of them, while mortars can suppress infantry in a circular area around their target. Some abilities, like grenades, artillery or strafing runs, can also suppress infantry. You can tell if an enemy unit is suppressed by the yellow or red icons above their heads.
- Upgrade your infantry with weapons and abilities that suit your strategy. Upgrades can give your infantry an advantage over certain types of enemies or situations. For example, you can equip your riflemen with BARs or grenades to make them more effective against other infantry, or sticky bombs to damage enemy vehicles. You can equip your volksgrenadiers with MP40s to make them deadly at close range, or panzerfausts to deter enemy armor. You can also research abilities that enhance your infantry's performance, like field craft, veterancy or medkits.
- Use abilities wisely and at the right time. Abilities can turn the tide of a battle if used correctly, but they also cost resources and have cooldowns. For example, you can use a grenade to flush out an enemy squad from cover or a building, but you need to time it well and aim it accurately. You can use a panzerfaust to damage an enemy vehicle, but you need to get close enough and avoid getting killed by its return fire. You can use a strafing run to suppress or kill multiple enemy squads, but you need to anticipate their movement and avoid friendly fire.

By following these tips, you will be able to master the infantry combat in Company of Heroes and dominate the battlefield with your foot soldiers.
